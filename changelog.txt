ALSO: Pods Gravity Forms 2.0 is still in development and it brings complete compatibility with the latest Gravity Forms releases. We could use your support to help it get over the finish line this year. Please consider [donating to the Pods project](https://friends.pods.io/) to help us get there more quickly.

= 1.4.5 - July 22nd, 2022 =

* Tested against WP 6.0
* Added: Not seeing something map correctly? As a site admin, you now have the power to debug the form submission and see what might be going on. Add `?pods_gf_debug_gf_to_pods=1` to the URL of the form action before submitting to take advantage of the admin-only debug mode. This will output the values as they would be sent to Pods, the entry information used to reference it, and the feed options used at the time. It will stop the form from completely saving to Pods so you can tweak and debug your form feeds however much you'd like to perfect them. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Conditional checks for feeds has been resolved and now won't get confused when there are multiple feeds for the same form in certain cases. (@sc0ttkclark)
* Fixed: Additional compatibility with Gravity Flow. #157 (@JoryHogeveen)
* Pods 2.9 is in beta and after it is released, new mapping of GF List Fields to Pods repeatable fields will be added. This add-on will also be updated with minimum version requirements updated for WP 5.5+, Pods 2.8+, and Gravity Forms 2.5+. Complete testing will be done at that time to ensure complete compatibility.

= 1.4.4 - October 6th, 2021 =

= 1.4 - October 16th, 2018 =

* Support: Added support for Gravity Forms 2.3 database tables changes (You may see a warning on the Edit Pod screen but this is a false positive because we cache a list of all tables to transients and it triggers the warning solved by removing those old "rg" tables)
* Changed: Backwards compatibility issue -- You can now more easily set custom override values, however the old style was not able to be brought over -- you'll want to update your feeds when possible, the old values will not show up and you'll have to select the custom override value option once more, then fill it in

* Feature: When editing entries in the admin area, changes now sync to the associated Pod item (except trash/deletes)

* Feature: New Custom fields section added for Pods that support meta (Posts, Terms, Users, Media, and Comments), you can set additional custom fields including ability to set custom values there too

* Added: Support for E-mail field mappings with 'Confirm E-mail' enabled
* Added: Support for Date fields with multiple inputs (date dropdown / text fields)
* Added: Smarter requirement handling for WP object fields based on object type (only require what the WP insert API requires)

* Added: Rewrote the whole File Upload field mapping logic and tested against Single/Multi file fields (props @mika31, @copperleaf, @zanematthew, @zorog, @chriswagoner for testing help, props @spivurno for official GF support code help)
* Added: Support for feeds with submissions from the forms embedded on the dashboard and in the admin area (props @richardW8k)

* Fixed: Removed some issues that were causing PHP notices


= 1.1 - June 13th, 2016 =

* Added: Support for edit mode when using the Pods GF add-on mapping in the GF UI -- Use the new filter `pods_gf_addon_edit_id`, just return the ID to edit and the options will automatically be set for you
* Added: When filtering the Pods data in `Pods_GF::gf_to_pods()` (via the `pods_gf_to_pods_data` and related filters), if you set the proper ID field in that array it will now be used to *save* over the existing item; Helpful for dynamic editing configurations based upon different processes and workflows in the code
* Added: `Pods_GF::confirmation()` now supports `{@gf_to_pods_id}` replacement in confirmation URLs, replacing the variable properly to the resulting saved ID
* Fixed: `Pods_GF::_gf_to_pods_handler()` would sometimes get the action improperly set to `edit`, but only `add`, `save`, or `bypass` are valid
* Fixed: When an invalid pod is called in `Pods_GF::_gf_to_pods_handler()`, there's now a proper fallback to avoid PHP errors/warnings/notices
* Fixed: When an invalid pod is called in `Pods_GF::_gf_field_validation()`, there's now a proper fallback to avoid PHP errors/warnings/notices
* Fixed: `Pods_GF::confirmation()` would add the `gform_confirmation_{$form_id}` filter incorrectly and would cause PHP warnings about the callback, causing the confirmation functionality to not work properly
* Fixed: `Pods_GF::confirmation()` confirmation URL replacement now handles a few more cases where previously PHP notices would result
* Changed: `Pods_GF` is now storing multiple instances statically, cannot be called with `new Pods_GF()`, must be called with `Pods_GF::get_instance()` but more importantly should be called through the standard `pods_gf()` helper function to remain backwards compatible with previous versions
* Changed: `Pods_GF::$gf_to_pods_id` is no longer an integer, but an array of integers keyed by the GF Form ID
* Changed: `Pods_GF::$keep_files` is no longer an boolean, but an array of booleans keyed by the GF Form ID

* Initial release
